                Reimagining Modern UI for Blazor

                    shadcn/ui revolutionized React development by reimagining how developers build UIs. Instead of rigid component libraries, 
                    it provided beautiful, accessible components that you truly own—no package dependencies, just copy-paste-customize.

                    NeoBlazorUI brings this philosophy to the Blazor ecosystem. We've carefully adapted every shadcn/ui component 
                    for native Blazor, maintaining the same elegance, accessibility, and developer experience that made shadcn/ui a phenomenon.

                <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                    But we didn't stop there. We've enhanced the architecture with .NET-first patterns, full IntelliSense support, 
                    and seamless integration with all Blazor render modes. The result is a truly native Blazor experience that feels 
                    natural to .NET developers.

                    This is the shadcn of Blazor—components you own, a design system you control, and the flexibility to build 
                    exactly what your application needs.
